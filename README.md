Automated Extraction of Soil Temperature Parameters from Batch Climate Files Using RStudio: An Open Workflow for TRNSYS Type 49 and Type 77 Configuration under Climate Change Scenarios

This s an automated and open workflow in RStudio for extracting key soil temperature parameters—average surface temperature, annual range, and phase shift—from batch climatological files (e.g., TMY) in order to configure the "Slab on Grade" and "Simple Ground Temperature Model " (Types 49 and 77) in the TRNSYS software.
